SKU stands for Stock Keeping Unit. It's a unique identifier used by businesses to track products in their inventory. Each SKU is typically a combination of letters and numbers that represent specific details about the product, such as its type, brand, color, size, and other attributes.

Key Points about SKUs:
Uniqueness: Each SKU is unique to a particular product within a business. No two products should share the same SKU, which helps in accurately tracking inventory.
Internal Use: Unlike barcodes, which are often standardized and can be scanned universally, SKUs are typically used internally by a business to manage inventory.
Customizable: SKUs can be customized by the business to include specific information that's relevant to them. For example, a clothing retailer might use an SKU like SHIRT-BLK-LG to represent a black large-sized shirt.
Inventory Management: SKUs are crucial in inventory management systems for organizing, tracking, and managing stock. They help in identifying which products are selling well, which ones are running low, and which need restocking.
Example of an SKU:
Imagine you run a shoe store, and you have a product that is a red running shoe in size 10. You might create an SKU like this:

SH-RUN-RED-10
This SKU could break down as:

SH: Stands for "Shoe"
RUN: Indicates it's a running shoe
RED: The color of the shoe
10: The size of the shoe
This SKU allows you to quickly identify and track this specific product in your inventory system.


In the context of inventory and billing systems, **categories** are used to organize and classify products or services into groups that share common characteristics. This organization helps businesses manage their inventory more efficiently and provides customers with an easier way to navigate and find products.

### Importance of Categories:

1. **Organizational Structure:** Categories create a hierarchical structure for your inventory, making it easier to manage and locate products.
2. **Efficient Inventory Management:** By categorizing products, businesses can quickly identify stock levels within specific categories and make informed decisions about restocking.
3. **Enhanced Customer Experience:** In an online store or POS system, categories help customers find what they’re looking for faster, improving the overall shopping experience.
4. **Reporting and Analysis:** Categories allow for more detailed sales and inventory reports, enabling businesses to analyze performance by category and adjust their strategies accordingly.

### Common Types of Categories:

1. **Product Type:** Groups products by their type, such as electronics, clothing, furniture, etc.
   - Example: Electronics, Apparel, Home Goods

2. **Brand:** Organizes products by their brand or manufacturer.
   - Example: Nike, Apple, Samsung

3. **Price Range:** Products are categorized by their price, which can help in segmenting the market.
   - Example: Budget, Mid-range, Premium

4. **Seasonal:** Products are grouped based on the season or occasion.

### Example of Categories in a Clothing Store:

Imagine you have an online clothing store. Your categories might look like this:

  - T-Shirts
  - Jeans
  - Jackets
  - Shoes

Each category can also have subcategories, allowing for a more granular organization of products. For example, under "Men’s Clothing," you might have subcategories like "T-Shirts" and "Jeans."

### Summary
